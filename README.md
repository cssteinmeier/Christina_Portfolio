## Modeling Carbon Footprint for California and China's Wood Imports
### UC Berkeley Potts Lab Group
*June 2021-present*

● **Project Goal:** understand trade flow of wood products into China and California from 2010-2020 and model the carbon footprint of these imports

● Conduct exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on comprehensive datasets of California’s and China’s wood imports using **Pandas** and **GeoPandas**

● Create visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** to better understand the quantities of imports from various countries and the types of wood products being imported

● Estimate carbon emissions and carbon storage over the next 100 years from these imports using models from literature review
