## Carbon Footprint for California and China's Wood Imports
### UC Berkeley Potts Lab Group
*June 2021-present*

● **Project Goal:** understand trade flow of wood products into China and California from 2010-2020 and model the carbon footprint of these imports

● Conduct exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on comprehensive datasets of California’s and China’s wood imports using **Pandas** and **GeoPandas**

● Create visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** to better understand the quantities of imports from various countries and the types of wood products being imported

● Estimate carbon emissions and carbon storage over the next 100 years from these imports using models from literature review

## Vehicle Miles Traveled Across Census Tracts in The United States
### EcoDataLab
*June 2021-August 2021*

● Pulled Census data from **SocialExplorer**

● Conducted feature engineering to match the structure of the National Household Travel Survey data using **Pandas** and **Numpy**

● Trained a **multiple linear regression model** to predict the average vehicle miles traveled for a given census tract

● Used **stepwise regression** to determine statistically significant variables

● Evaluated and tuned model using Adjusted R-squared value 

● **Results:** multiple linear regression model that predicts the average vehicle miles traveled of a resident in a given census tract with an Adjusted R-squared of 0.3096

## Explore Public Benefit Referral Programs Data in Los Angeles County
### UC Berkeley Data Discover Program
*January 2021-May 2021*

● Worked in partnership with United Ways of California and Alluma to explore public benefit referral programs in Los Angeles County

● Pulled micro-census data to create a proxy dataset for users’ demographics using **Pandas** and **GeoPandas**

● Modeled referrals with proxy demographic data to better understand benefit programs’ usage and shortcomings in **Tableau**
