## Carbon Footprint for California and China's Wood Imports
### UC Berkeley Potts Lab Group
*June 2021-present*

The **goal** of this project is to understand the trade flow and model the carbon footprint of wood products into China and California from 2010-2020. I conducted exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on comprehensive datasets of California’s and China’s wood imports using **Pandas** and **GeoPandas**. After initial cleaning was complete, I created visualizations, using **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**, to better understand the quantities of imports from various countries and the types of wood products being imported. Below shows the analysis for timber, but I did this for lumber, panel, paper, pulp, and furnitfure, as well.

The next step of the project is to estimate carbon emissions and carbon storage over the next 100 years. We used modeled obtained through literature review to make these predictions.

## Vehicle Miles Traveled Across Census Tracts in The United States
### EcoDataLab
*June 2021-August 2021*

● Pulled Census data from **SocialExplorer**

● Conducted feature engineering to match the structure of the National Household Travel Survey data using **Pandas** and **Numpy**

● Trained a **multiple linear regression model** to predict the average vehicle miles traveled for a given census tract

● Used **stepwise regression** to determine statistically significant variables

● Evaluated and tuned model using Adjusted R-squared value 

● **Results:** multiple linear regression model that predicts the average vehicle miles traveled of a resident in a given census tract with an Adjusted R-squared of 0.3096

## Explore Public Benefit Referral Programs Data in Los Angeles County
### UC Berkeley Data Discover Program
*January 2021-May 2021*

● Worked in partnership with United Ways of California and Alluma to explore public benefit referral programs in Los Angeles County

● Pulled micro-census data to create a proxy dataset for users’ demographics using **Pandas** and **GeoPandas**

● Modeled referrals with proxy demographic data to better understand benefit programs’ usage and shortcomings in **Tableau**
